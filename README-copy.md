### Backoffice

To access the administrator Backoffice you have to click over the small "head with a hat" icon in the footer of the page. This will make visible a "Login" button.

When you click the "Login" button you'll be redirected to the login form where you should put your admin credentials. For the moment it is not possible to register a new user.

Then you will enter the backoffice panel which is composed of 7 sections.
